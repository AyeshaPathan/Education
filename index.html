                With online learning, your learners can access content anywhere and anytime. They don’t need to take
                time out from their jobs to attend classes. E-learning is also cost-effective; companies save a
                substantial amount on the travel and accommodation costs of both learners and instructors, as well as
                the venue and materials. No printing helps reduce your carbon footprint, too.
                Modern learners prefer bite-sized, interactive content. They would rather watch a video or listen to a
                podcast than read through pages of a manual. E-learning tools enable learning designers to make content
                interactive. The more engaging the content is, the better the learners remember information. If they
                enjoy learning, they can able to recall and apply the concepts at work.

                    Learning is the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, attitudes,
                    and preferences. ... The nature and processes involved in learning are studied in many fields, including
                    educational psychology, neuropsychology, experimental psychology, and pedagogy.
                    There are six interactive components of the learning process: attention, memory, language, processing
                    and organizing, graphomotor (writing) and higher order thinking. These processes interact not only with
                    each other, but also with emotions, classroom climate, behavior, social skills, teachers and family.

                        we provide online classes for all subjects.
                        In the rural parts of India a lot of children and adults are unable to receive proper education. We as
                        humans should come forward and bring about the transformation.
                        Sports should be an important part of the curriculum.The most important part that should be included is
                        knowledge of health be it physical or mental it has to be inculcated in every individual.
